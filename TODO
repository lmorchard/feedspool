TODO

* How to handle "updated" entries with the same ID?  (See: Slate RSS)

* Make miniagg watch feed entry IDs for freshness.

* Popular links feed, next generation from the book

* Plugin which traps XML errors, "repairs" feed with feedparser normalization, respools

* Plugin to auto-disable / report bad feeds, 404 feeds, other HTTP errors

* Feed errors logged as a feed?  404, 410, 401, misc exceptions

* Configuration for plugins.  Overlay with main config?

* Stale entry cleaner plugin
    * Gets list of entries in spool
    * Ignores entries still in the feed
    * Deletes entries over N seconds old

* Plugin hooks:

    * Additional hook types
        * Munge / filter feed data after fetch
        * Munge / filter entry data after spool
        * Need plugins which can add commands to CLI

    * Executable files in plugin dir structure (keep it unixy / djb-esque)
        * Offer examples where little scripts use pipes to talk to a bigger persistent process
            * Need pipe locking?

* Multi-process feed polling
    * Process locks feed config to "claim" it for poll
    * Plugins called single-process for poll start/end; multi-process for others.

* See about using per-feed overlay config for setting up per-channel logging

BLUE SKY
