TODO

* Plugin hooks:
    * Executable files in plugin dir structure (keep it unixy / djb-esque)
        * Offer examples where little scripts use pipes to talk to a bigger persistent process
            * Need pipe locking?
    * Called single-process for poll start/end; multi-process for others.
    * Hooks
        * Scan started
        * Feed poll start
            * Only on changed data?
        * New entry found
        * Feed poll end
        * Scan ended

* Multi-process feed polling
    * Process locks feed config to "claim" it for poll

* See about using per-feed overlay config for setting up per-channel logging

BLUE SKY

* Offer an HTTP proxy which serves up feeds from the spool?
* Perform feed scans on ping-o-matic-style RPC ping, supported by web service
* Perform feed scans on PubSub notification / weblogs.com notice
* Perform feed scans on Jabber IM ping
