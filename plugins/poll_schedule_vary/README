This provides a plugin which varies the polling period for feeds using an
AIMD-inspired algorithm:  

Each time new entries are found, the polling period jumps to a shorter value
via multiplication by a given factor (ie. 0.5).  When new entries are not found
on a poll, the polling period is incremented to a bit longer by a given value
(ie. 30 minutes).

The intended effect is that, when a feed is quiet, the aggregator gradually
waits longer and longer between checking it.  However, as soon as the feed
shows any activity, it quickly ramps up in anticipation of more activity in the
near future.  

Over time, this algorithm should naturally settle on a decent guess at a good
polling period for any given feed.
